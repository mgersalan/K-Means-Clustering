# K-Means-Clustering
Full implementation of K Means Clustering with 2 different case

In the first case 2 dimensional random data generated and k-means clustering applied. 
Visualization of each iteration is also included in the code.

In the second case I used 28 x 28 images from Mnist datasets and applied k means clustering to them.
